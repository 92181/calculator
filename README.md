# Simple JS Calculator
A small and lightweight calculator library/template, It gives a good illustration on how a calculator parses a string and resolves the containing calculation. It has no dependencies and can be used freely in a web application for example.
It is also fairly light-weight.

Various things that it can do are...
* Handle floating point inaccuracies and return a high resolution result.
* Perform complex calculations such as π+5π2 and 5!%4^2.
* The unminified version is just 1.4 KB large making it capable of being used in virtually any package without any major drawbacks.

# Usage
You can try it out directly in your browser although locally. The calculator logic is packaged in the same file as the demo. You can extract the logic and build around it if you wish to do so.
