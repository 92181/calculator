# JS Calculator

A small and lightweight calculator library/template, It gives a good illustration on how a calculator parses a string and resolves the containing calculation. It has no dependencies and can be used freely in a web application for example. It is also fairly light-weight, the not minified version is just 1.44 KB. It deals with floating point innaccuracies accordingly.

# Usage

It can perform fairly complex calculations, such as π+5π2 and 5!%4^2. You can try it out directly in your browser although locally. The calculator logic is packaged in the same file as the demo. You can extract the logic and build around it if you wish to do so.
